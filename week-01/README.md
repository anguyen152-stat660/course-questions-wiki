[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 1]
- Question (flee11-stat660): Could a step still be considered "Completed" if Professor Lankham asked for resubmission? Or does one have to achieve "Completed" upon the first attempt?
- Question (flee11-stat660): For component (10), by "customized", the question asks for the screenshot of our __*modified*__ codes of the fizz-buzz recipe codes given in the box, not the screenshot of the fizz-buzz recipe codes given in the box, correct?
- Answer (flee11-stat660): Correct, screenshot of our modified codes. And by "customized", it means editing the codes given in the box so that all 3 conditions below are fulfilled: 
* If a number is only divisible by 3, print first name.
* If a number is only divisible by 5, print last name.
* If a number is divisible by 15, print both first name and last name.


[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 2]
- Question (flee11-stat660): It says in the Course Structure quiz solution: "There will tentatively be 15 Weekly Forum Posts." In both the Course Syllabus and the Course Alignment Map, there are 16 weekly forum posts. Will the 16th week forum post be optional? Will we still need 12 out of 16 weekly posts completed to earn the Reading for Breadth achievement in the course?
- Question (flee11-stat660): FlowingData Blog (http://flowingdata.com/) is one of the websites provided by Professor Lankham. When I clicked on a blogpost on that website, it led me to another website (the website of Harvard Business Review). I ended up reading the full article on the Harvard Business Review website. Would that still be considered technically an article from the FlowingData Blog website?
- Answer (flee11-stat660): Yes, I hope so.


[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 3]
- Question (flee11-stat660): How much would one have to score on a weekly quiz for that quiz to be considered "completed", and to be counted toward the total of 12 quizzes "completed" to earn the Reading for Depth achievement in the course? 
- Question (flee11-stat660): It says in the Course Structure quiz solution: "There will tentatively be 15 Weekly Quizzes." In both the Course Syllabus and the Course Alignment Map, there are 16 weekly quizzes. Will the 16th week quiz be optional? Will we still need 12 out of 16 weekly quizzes completed to earn the Reading for Depth achievement in the course? 

[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 4]
- Question (flee11-stat660): Will there be report writing or presentation at the end of the two team-based projects?
- Question (flee11-stat660): Will the team be created according to similar interests for the projects? Will we have different teams for the two projects?


[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 5]
- Question (flee11-stat660): Will any score between 70 and 100 on the final exam be treated the same way, in the sense that  they will all earn the Building General Knowlege achievement for the course?


[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 6]
- Question (flee11-stat660): Is the Team-based Problem Solving Achievement given the same weight in one's final course letter grade as any other Achievement (such as Initial Setup Achievement and Buiding General Knowledge Achievement)? For example, one can still get an A- if all achievements (except the Team-based achievement) were earned?


[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 7]
- Question (flee11-stat660): By "incomplete submissions can be eligible for resubmission at the instructor's discretion", does it mean that upon receiving Professor Lankham's feedback, one should attempt to resubmit with errors fixed?


[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 8]
- Question (flee11-stat660): Should we post in the #-q-and-a-and-a channel (in the course Slack Workspace) any typos or lack of clarity in any course materials?
- Answer (flee11-stat660): Yes, or DM Professor Lankham?


[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 9]
- Question (flee11-stat660): When this course STAT 660 ends in December 2018, will we lose access to all the slack messages exchanged in the course Slack workspace during the entire semester?
- Question (flee11-stat660): Is there a place where one can post and read our classmates' posts for commonly asked questions, instead of each person indiviually DM the professor perhaps similar questions?


[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 10]
- Question (flee11-stat660): Will we be able to see the questions our classmates created for each quiz? Will some of our questions get answered by the professor or classmates?


[hello_world Week 1 SAS Recipe]
- Question (flee11-stat660): The instruction for the hello world Week 1 SAS Recipe says: "Open SAS 9.4 in BayCloud (or SAS University Edition, if BayCloud VCL is not yet setup), and then type in and run the following hello-world recipe". Can we instead use SAS software installed to our own computers for this exercise and any future exercises in this SAS course? Baycloud tends to disconnect unexpectedly for me.


[fizz_buzz Week 1 SAS Recipe]
- Question (flee11-stat660): Can we use single quotation marks instead of double quotation marks in the given fizz buzz SAS codes? Will SAS run without error and still give us the correct results?
- Answer (flee11-stat660): Yes, single quotation marks work too, and SAS will run without error and still give us the correct results.
