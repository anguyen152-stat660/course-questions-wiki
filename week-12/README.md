In order to prepare your Week 12 Quiz submission, please edit ***this*** document to provide substantive questions for each Quiz Problem and SAS Recipe listed below, as well as answers to at least three questions raised.

All edits should conform to GitHub Markdown specifications (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and should be committed to a branch named "week-12" in your fork of this repo. Then, after all edits have been made/committed, your Week 12 Quiz should be submitted by initiating a pull request using

[Course Textbook Chapter 16, Problem 1]
- Question (llopez37-stat660)Do we include the other variables in the keep syntax in order to allow for the if statement to go into affect? 



[Course Textbook Chapter 16, Problem 2]
- Question (llopez37-stat660) Is this due to the set syntax which is setting that data set into the new data set that we wanted to create? 
- Answer (llopez37-stat660) It seems this is the case, the data step is setting the data set. 



[Course Textbook Chapter 16, Problem 3]
- Question (llopez37-stat660)How would we go about getting this to print out on the output? 



[Course Textbook Chapter 16, Problem 4]
- Question (llopez37-stat660)Is this just an example or what would be the purpose of a code such as this? 



[Course Textbook Chapter 16, Problem 5]
- Question (llopez37-stat660)How would we go about printing the first 5 observations starting from the 4th observation?
- Answer (llopez37-stat6660) From what I could find this is where the start syntax might work out.



[Course Textbook Chapter 16, Problem 6]
- Question (llopez37-stat660)Why does it print out 1 observation and not the 5 that we set obsnum to equal? 



[Course Textbook Chapter 16, Problem 7]
- Question (llopez37-stat660)An error occurs because we do not finish the If then syntax on the last line? 
- Answer (llopez37-stat660) It appears to be the case when running that the syntax runs into an error.



[Course Textbook Chapter 16, Problem 8]
- Question (llopez37-stat660)If there are no observations this is strictly the PDV and then the observations begin to populate?



[Week 12 SAS Recipe: recipe_to_disaggregate_counts_data]
- Question (llopez37-stat660)So for this case, would we have observations during PDV as opposed to the last problem? 



[Week 12 SAS Recipe: recipe_to_create_unique_record_id]
- Question (llopez37-stat660) How strong is the disaggregate capabilities as in can you disaggregate code that you did not manipulate yourself or do not have the raw data set?
