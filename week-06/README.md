[Course Textbook Chapter 7, Problem 1]
- Question (llopez37-stat660) Is this the best way to determine whether to use proc logic statements to find errors?



[Course Textbook Chapter 7, Problem 2]
- Question (llopez37-stat660) Does SAS also scan each step for logic errors or does that end the compilation phase? 
- Answer (llopez37-stat660) From what I could find it seems this is why proc logic exists.

- Question (llopez37-stat660) Is each record per data point or per line? 



[Course Textbook Chapter 7, Problem 4]
- Question (llopez37-stat660) Would fixing this error come down to the log or can we use a statement to identify why this error occurred?



[Course Textbook Chapter 7, Problem 5]
- Question (llopez37-stat660) Is there a way to change it from a binary level to show an actual number of errors?
- Answer (llopez37-stat660) It seems like the errors will show up on logs so binary will suffice.
