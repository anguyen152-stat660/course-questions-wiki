[Course Textbook Chapter 13, Problem 1]
- Question (llopez37-stat660) Why does it not combine all and leave missing for some observations?



[Course Textbook Chapter 13, Problem 2]
- Question (llopez37-stat660) In order to preserve all observations is the by statement necessary?
- Answer (llopez37-stat660) It seems that the by statement preserves all observations in that variable



[Course Textbook Chapter 13, Problem 3]
- Question (llopez37-stat660) So if no by statement is used then the smallest size of observations is what follows? 
- Answer (llopez37-stat660) From googling it seems that if the size of the output matches it will follow through together without drop off as opposed to problem 1



[Course Textbook Chapter 13, Problem 4]
- Question (llopez37-stat660) Is this due to the fact that there are multiple ID variables with observation 2?



[Course Textbook Chapter 13, Problem 5]
- Question (llopez37-stat660) Is there a way to have data set 1 overwrite data set 2 in case you have the improper order of data sets for when you merge?



[Course Textbook Chapter 13, Problem 7]
- Question (llopez37-stat660) Why does ths prevent blue from being overwritten does it rename it as it process the code or what is the stack look like in this process? 



[Course Textbook Chapter 13, Problem 9]
- Question (llopez37-stat660) If we did not use the by statement here, then it would only be 4 observations?



[Week 9 SAS Recipe: basic_recipe_for_combining_data_horizontally]
- Question (llopez37-stat660) How exactly does merge differ from combining the sets with what we learned in the chapter? 
- Answer (llopez37-stat660) It seems that merge will force combine the data sets but with the other method it will base it off of by statements or the size of rows on the second data set.



[Week 9 SAS Recipe: adv_recipe_for_combining_data_horizontally]
- Question (llopez37-stat660) Is proc sql limitations on memory or why do we not focus on proc sql since it seems so powerful?
